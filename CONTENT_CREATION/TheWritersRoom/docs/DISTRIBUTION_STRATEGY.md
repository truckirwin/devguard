# The Writers Room - Distribution Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the strategy for creating "The Writers Room" as a standalone VS Code-based product. Instead of building from scratch, we leverage VS Code as the foundation and create a custom distribution with The Writers Room extension pre-installed and configured.

## Distribution Architecture

### Approach: Portable VS Code + Extension Bundle

```
TheWritersRoom-Distribution/
├── The Writers Room.app/          # macOS app bundle
│   ├── Contents/
│   │   ├── Resources/app/
│   │   │   ├── data/              # Portable data directory
│   │   │   │   ├── extensions/    # Pre-installed extensions
│   │   │   │   ├── user-data/     # User settings and workspaces
│   │   │   │   └── sample-project/ # Welcome project
│   │   │   └── ...                # VS Code files
│   │   └── Info.plist             # Custom app metadata
├── TheWritersRoom.bat             # Windows launcher
└── writers-room.sh               # Linux launcher
```

### Key Benefits

✅ **No Cursor Interference**: Completely separate from your development environment  
✅ **Full VS Code Power**: All VS Code features included  
✅ **Pre-configured**: Ready-to-use out of the box  
✅ **Portable**: Doesn't require installation or admin rights  
✅ **Brandable**: Custom name, icon, and configuration  
✅ **Professional**: Feels like a real product, not just an extension  

## How It Works

### 1. VS Code Foundation
- Downloads the latest stable VS Code for target platform
- Extracts and prepares portable installation
- Disables telemetry and auto-updates

### 2. Extension Integration
- Packages your Writers Room extension
- Pre-installs it in the portable VS Code
- Configures it to be active by default

### 3. Custom Configuration
- Sets up writer-friendly defaults
- Creates sample project structure
- Configures themes and settings for creative writing

### 4. Branding and Packaging
- Custom app name and icon
- Platform-specific launchers
- Professional installer packages

## Build Process

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Ensure you have build tools
# macOS: Xcode command line tools
# Windows: Visual Studio Build Tools
# Linux: build-essential
```

### Building Distribution

```bash
# Build for current platform
npm run build:dist

# Build for specific platform
npm run build:mac      # macOS
npm run build:windows  # Windows

# Build for all platforms
npm run build:all
```

### Build Output

```
# macOS
