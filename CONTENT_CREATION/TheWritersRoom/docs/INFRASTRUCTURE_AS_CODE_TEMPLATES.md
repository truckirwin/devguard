# Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Templates Design

## The Writers Room â€“ AWS-Native Creative Writing IDE

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) strategy for The Writers Room, detailing the AWS resources, recommended tools, modularization, environment management, and best practices for secure, scalable, and repeatable cloud deployments.

---

## 1. IaC Tooling Strategy

- **Primary Tools**: Terraform (preferred for multi-cloud and modularity), AWS CDK (for TypeScript/Python-native teams), or AWS CloudFormation (for AWS-only, YAML/JSON-first teams).
- **State Management**: Use remote state (e.g., S3 with DynamoDB locking for Terraform) for team collaboration and CI/CD.
- **Version Control**: All IaC code stored in Git, with PR-based review and automated checks.

---

## 2. Core AWS Resources to Provision

- **Networking**: VPC, subnets (public/private), NAT gateways, route tables, security groups
- **Compute**: Lambda functions, API Gateway, Step Functions, ECS (if needed)
- **Identity**: Cognito user pools, IAM roles/policies, KMS keys
- **Storage**: S3 buckets (with encryption, versioning, lifecycle), Aurora Serverless, DynamoDB, ElastiCache (Redis), OpenSearch
- **AI/ML**: Bedrock, SageMaker endpoints (if needed)
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch (logs, metrics, alarms), X-Ray, SNS for alerts
- **Other**: Secrets Manager, Parameter Store, CodeBuild/CodePipeline for CI/CD

---

## 3. Modularization & Structure

- **Root Module**: Orchestrates all submodules, manages global resources (e.g., VPC, IAM root roles)
- **Submodules**:
  - `networking/` (VPC, subnets, NAT, security groups)
  - `compute/` (Lambda, API Gateway, Step Functions, ECS)
  - `identity/` (Cognito, IAM, KMS)
  - `storage/` (S3, Aurora, DynamoDB, ElastiCache, OpenSearch)
  - `ai/` (Bedrock, SageMaker)
  - `monitoring/` (CloudWatch, X-Ray, SNS)
  - `cicd/` (CodeBuild, CodePipeline, deployment roles)
- **Environment Overlays**: Separate configs for `dev`, `staging`, `prod` (e.g., using Terraform workspaces or CDK stacks)

---

## 4. Environment Management

- **Isolation**: Each environment (dev, staging, prod) has isolated resources and state.
- **Naming Conventions**: Use environment prefixes/suffixes for all resources (e.g., writersroom-dev-*, writersroom-prod-*)
- **Secrets**: Store secrets in AWS Secrets Manager or SSM Parameter Store, never in code.

---

## 5. Security & Compliance Best Practices

- **Least Privilege**: IAM roles/policies grant only required permissions
- **Encryption**: All data at rest and in transit encrypted (S3, Aurora, OpenSearch, etc.)
- **Audit Logging**: Enable CloudTrail, VPC flow logs, and resource-level logging
- **Resource Policies**: Restrict S3, OpenSearch, and other endpoints to VPC/private access where possible
- **Automated Compliance**: Use tools like AWS Config, Security Hub, and Terraform Sentinel for policy enforcement

---

## 6. CI/CD Integration

- **Automated Deployments**: Use CodePipeline, GitHub Actions, or similar for IaC deployment
- **Validation**: Lint, validate, and plan all changes in CI before apply
- **Rollback**: Automated rollback on failure

---

## 7. Documentation & Onboarding

- **README in each module**: Explains inputs, outputs, usage, and dependencies
- **Diagrams**: Include architecture diagrams (e.g., Mermaid, draw.io) for each major module
- **Getting Started Guide**: Step-by-step for new developers to deploy a dev environment

---

## 8. Next Steps

1. Select primary IaC tool (recommend Terraform for modularity and AWS support)
2. Scaffold root and core submodules
3. Define environment overlays and state management
4. Implement CI/CD for IaC
5. Document all modules and onboarding steps

---

## Conclusion

A modular, secure, and automated IaC approach ensures The Writers Room can scale, adapt, and maintain compliance as the platform grows. This document serves as the blueprint for all future infrastructure automation.
