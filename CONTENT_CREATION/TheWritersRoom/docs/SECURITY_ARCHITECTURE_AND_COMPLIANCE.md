# Security Architecture & Compliance Framework

## The Writers Room â€“ AWS-Native Creative Writing IDE

---

## Executive Summary

This document defines the security architecture and compliance framework for The Writers Room, outlining AWS-native controls, policies, and best practices to ensure data protection, privacy, and regulatory compliance for creative writing teams and enterprises.

---

## 1. Identity & Access Management (IAM)

- **Principle of Least Privilege**: All IAM roles and policies grant only the minimum permissions required.
- **Separation of Duties**: Distinct roles for developers, admins, and automation.
- **Federated Access**: Use AWS Cognito for user authentication (MFA required), SSO for enterprise teams.
- **Service Roles**: Lambda, Step Functions, and ECS tasks use dedicated IAM roles with scoped permissions.
- **Key Management**: All KMS keys are managed with strict access controls and rotation policies.

---

## 2. Data Protection & Encryption

- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.2+ for all endpoints (API Gateway, S3, Aurora, OpenSearch, etc.).
- **Encryption at Rest**: SSE-KMS for S3, TDE for Aurora, encryption for OpenSearch and ElastiCache.
- **Field-Level Encryption**: Sensitive fields (PII, credentials) encrypted at the application or database level.
- **Key Rotation**: Automatic KMS key rotation enabled; manual rotation for application secrets.

---

## 3. Network Security

- **VPC Isolation**: All compute and storage resources deployed in private subnets; public access only via API Gateway/ALB.
- **Security Groups & NACLs**: Strict ingress/egress rules; deny-all by default.
- **Endpoint Policies**: S3, OpenSearch, and other services restricted to VPC endpoints where possible.
- **WAF & Shield**: Web Application Firewall and DDoS protection enabled for all public endpoints.

---

## 4. Monitoring, Logging & Incident Response

- **Centralized Logging**: All logs (CloudWatch, VPC Flow Logs, CloudTrail) aggregated and retained per policy.
- **Alerting**: CloudWatch Alarms and SNS for security events, anomalies, and threshold breaches.
- **Automated Response**: Use AWS Lambda and Step Functions for automated remediation (e.g., quarantine, key rotation).
- **Incident Playbooks**: Documented response procedures for data breach, privilege escalation, and service compromise.
- **Forensics**: Enable detailed audit trails and immutable log storage for investigations.

---

## 5. Compliance & Privacy

- **GDPR**: Data subject rights, data minimization, and right to erasure supported.
- **SOC 2**: Controls for security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy.
- **HIPAA (if applicable)**: PHI encrypted, access logged, and BAA in place.
- **Data Residency**: Support for region-specific data storage as required.
- **Vendor Management**: All third-party services reviewed for compliance.

---

## 6. Secure Development & Operations

- **CI/CD Security**: Secrets never stored in code; use Secrets Manager/SSM. All builds scanned for vulnerabilities.
- **Dependency Management**: Automated scanning for vulnerable libraries (e.g., Dependabot, AWS Inspector).
- **Code Reviews**: Mandatory security review for all PRs affecting authentication, authorization, or data flows.
- **Penetration Testing**: Regular third-party and internal security assessments.

---

## 7. Best Practices & Continuous Improvement

- **Security Training**: All team members complete annual security awareness training.
- **Policy Reviews**: Security policies and controls reviewed quarterly.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Use AWS Security Hub, GuardDuty, and Config for ongoing compliance and threat detection.
