# Error Handling & Logging Strategy

## The Writers Room â€“ AWS-Native Creative Writing IDE

---

## Executive Summary

This document defines the error handling and logging strategy for The Writers Room, ensuring robust diagnostics, user experience, and compliance using AWS-native tools and best practices.

---

## 1. Error Classification

- **User-Facing Errors**: Validation errors, permission issues, resource not found, etc. (clear, actionable messages)
- **Internal Errors**: System failures, exceptions, dependency outages (generic message to user, detailed log internally)
- **Severity Levels**: Info, Warning, Error, Critical

---

## 2. Error Handling Principles

- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues to function where possible
- **Consistent Error Codes**: Standardized error codes/messages across APIs
- **No Sensitive Data in User Errors**: Never expose stack traces, PII, or internal details
- **Retry Logic**: For transient errors (network, AWS throttling)

---

## 3. Logging Standards

- **Structured Logging**: JSON format with timestamp, request ID, user ID, error code, stack trace (if internal)
- **Correlation IDs**: Propagate request IDs across services for traceability
- **Log Levels**: Debug, Info, Warning, Error, Critical
- **PII Redaction**: Mask or exclude sensitive data from logs

---

## 4. AWS-Native Logging & Monitoring

- **CloudWatch Logs**: All application and Lambda logs aggregated here
- **CloudWatch Metrics & Alarms**: Custom metrics for error rates, latency, etc.
- **X-Ray**: Distributed tracing for debugging and performance analysis
- **SNS Alerts**: Notify on critical errors or threshold breaches

---

## 5. Retention, Privacy & Compliance

- **Retention**: Logs retained per policy (e.g., 90 days for app logs, 1 year for audit logs)
- **Access Control**: Logs accessible only to authorized roles
- **GDPR/SOC2**: Ensure logs do not contain PII; support right to erasure

---

## 6. Best Practices

- **Centralized Logging**: All logs routed to CloudWatch/X-Ray
- **Automated Log Rotation & Archival**: Use AWS retention policies
- **Regular Review**: Monitor logs and alerts for anomalies
- **Documentation**: Error codes and logging conventions documented for all teams

## Conclusion

This strategy ensures The Writers Room is resilient, observable, and compliant, enabling rapid troubleshooting and a secure user experience.
