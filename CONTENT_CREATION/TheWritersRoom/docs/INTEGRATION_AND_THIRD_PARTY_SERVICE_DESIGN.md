# Integration & Third-Party Service Design

## The Writers Room â€“ AWS-Native Creative Writing IDE

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the strategy for integrating third-party services and APIs into The Writers Room, ensuring secure, reliable, and scalable connections to AI models, version control, storage, and collaboration tools.

---

## 1. Integration Principles

- **Security First**: All integrations use secure authentication (OAuth, API keys, IAM roles)
- **Abstraction**: Internal APIs abstract third-party details from the UI and core logic
- **Resilience**: Retry logic, circuit breakers, and graceful degradation for external failures
- **Compliance**: All integrations reviewed for privacy, data residency, and compliance

---

## 2. Supported Integrations

- **AI Models**: AWS Bedrock (Claude, Titan, etc.), OpenAI, Anthropic (via secure API Gateway)
- **Version Control**: Git (abstracted for non-technical users), GitHub/GitLab APIs for team workflows
- **Cloud Storage**: S3 (primary), Google Drive/Dropbox (optional, via OAuth)
- **Communication**: Slack, email (SES), and future integrations (Teams, Discord)
- **Authentication**: AWS Cognito, SSO (SAML/OIDC) for enterprise

---

## 3. Authentication & API Management

- **API Gateway**: All external API calls routed through AWS API Gateway for monitoring and throttling
- **Secrets Management**: API keys and tokens stored in AWS Secrets Manager
- **OAuth Flows**: Used for user-initiated integrations (e.g., Google Drive, Slack)
- **IAM Roles**: Used for AWS-native integrations (Bedrock, S3, etc.)

---

## 4. Error Handling & Monitoring

- **Standardized Error Codes**: All integration errors mapped to internal codes/messages
- **Retries & Backoff**: For transient errors (network, rate limits)
- **Alerting**: CloudWatch Alarms and SNS for integration failures
- **Audit Logging**: All integration calls logged for traceability

---

## 5. Best Practices

- **API Versioning**: Support for multiple API versions to avoid breaking changes
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect third-party rate limits; use API Gateway throttling
- **Data Minimization**: Only request/store data required for functionality
- **Documentation**: All integrations documented with usage, error codes, and security considerations

## Conclusion

This integration strategy ensures The Writers Room can securely and reliably connect to best-in-class AI, storage, and collaboration services, while maintaining compliance and a seamless user experience.
