# DevOps & Deployment Strategy

## The Writers Room – AWS-Native Creative Writing IDE

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the DevOps and deployment strategy for The Writers Room, focusing on AWS-native automation, CI/CD, environment management, and operational best practices to ensure rapid, reliable, and secure delivery.

---

## 1. CI/CD Pipeline Design

- **Tools**: GitHub Actions, AWS CodePipeline, or similar
- **Stages**:
  - Lint & static analysis
  - Unit & integration tests
  - Build & package (UI, backend, Lambdas)
  - Deploy to dev/staging/prod
  - Post-deploy smoke tests
- **Triggers**: PRs to main branches, manual approvals for production

---

## 2. Environment Management

- **Environments**: dev, staging, prod (isolated AWS accounts or VPCs)
- **Promotion**: Artifacts and infrastructure changes flow from dev → staging → prod
- **State**: Use remote state for IaC (S3 + DynamoDB for Terraform)

---

## 3. Automated Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Run on every commit/PR
- **Integration Tests**: Run on merges to dev/staging
- **End-to-End Tests**: Run nightly and pre-prod
- **Performance Tests**: Run on demand or pre-release

---

## 4. Infrastructure Deployment

- **IaC**: All infrastructure changes via Terraform/CDK/CloudFormation
- **Validation**: Plan, validate, and review all changes in CI before apply
- **Rollback**: Automated rollback on failure (infrastructure and application)

---

## 5. Secrets & Configuration Management

- **Secrets**: Store in AWS Secrets Manager or SSM Parameter Store
- **Config**: Use environment variables and Parameter Store for non-secret config
- **No Secrets in Code**: Enforced by CI checks

---

## 6. Monitoring & Alerting

- **Application Monitoring**: CloudWatch, X-Ray, and custom metrics
- **Infrastructure Monitoring**: CloudWatch, AWS Config, Security Hub
- **Alerting**: SNS/email/Slack for critical events and failures

---

## 7. Best Practices

- **Immutable Deployments**: Use versioned artifacts and blue/green or canary deployments
- **Least Privilege**: CI/CD roles have only required permissions
- **Auditability**: All deployments and changes logged (CloudTrail, CodePipeline logs)
- **Documentation**: All pipeline steps and environment variables documented in repo

---

## Conclusion

This DevOps and deployment strategy ensures The Writers Room can deliver features and fixes rapidly, safely, and at scale, with full traceability and operational excellence.
