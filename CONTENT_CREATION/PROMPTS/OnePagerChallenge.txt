PROMPT:
I want to challenge you with the following ideas.
1. Perhaps the difference between ILT and self-paced digital is not 'modality', the means of communications. Perhaps they use different brain mechanisms to activate learning.
a. Digital self-paced learning is effective for foundational content, allowing learners to absorb material at their own pace and revisit concepts as needed. This approach engages self-regulation and metacognition, where learners plan, monitor, and assess their understanding. It taps into executive functions like decision-making, self-monitoring, and goal-setting. By spreading learning over time, it supports long-term memory consolidation. Success in self-paced learning depends on self-regulation, motivation, and effective use of memory.
b. Instructor-led training activates working memory due to the need to process information quickly without time for extended self-review. Attention networks are engaged by rapid feedback and the need to stay focused during real-time interaction. ILT reinforces learning through real-time processing, social interaction, and immediate feedback, engaging working memory, mirroring, attention networks, and social learning mechanisms.
2. Digital self-paced training works well for acquiring technical knowledge, while ILT excels in applied skills and decision-making. Digital training prepares learners for knowledge-based certification exams, while ILT equips them with the hands-on skills for practical tests and job performance.

Consider this in the context of reusability and RLOs. And how this might influence the design of the Continuity Generator. 

How can the mechanisms you describe bring ILT into alignment with certification and identify/target strategic ILT that is necessary for a complete learning path that both allows customers to pass certification tests and teaches them to perform on the job?
