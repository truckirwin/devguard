### Modes

**Voice Agent Mode**: Continuous listening for commands and natural language requests.
```
Press Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+V ‚Üí "Hey Cursor, create a new Python file"
```

**Dictation Mode**: Convert speech directly to text with AI improvement.
```
Press Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+D ‚Üí "function calculate sum parentheses x comma y parentheses"
```

## Configuration

Access settings via `Cursor Voice Control Panel` or directly in settings:

- **Language**: Speech recognition language (default: en-US)
- **Sensitivity**: Voice activation threshold (0.1-1.0)
- **Continuous Listening**: Always-on voice control
- **AI Assistance**: Enhanced command interpretation
- **Code Context**: Use file context for better recognition

## Advanced Features

### AI-Powered Text Improvement

When dictating code, the extension uses AI to:
- Fix speech recognition errors
- Convert spoken programming terms to proper syntax
- Add appropriate formatting and punctuation
- Apply language-specific conventions

### Context-Aware Commands

The extension understands your current coding context:
- File type and language
- Current cursor position
- Selected text
- Nearby code lines

This allows for more intelligent command interpretation and text processing.

### Custom Voice Commands

Customize voice commands in settings:

```json
{
  "cursorVoice.voiceCommands": {
    "openFile": ["open file", "open document"],
    "customCommand": ["my custom phrase", "alternative phrase"]
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Microphone Issues

1. **Permission Denied**: Grant microphone access in system settings
2. **No Audio Detected**: Check microphone levels and settings
3. **Poor Recognition**: Adjust sensitivity or try different microphone

### API Issues

1. **Deepgram Errors**: Verify API key and account credits
2. **OpenAI Errors**: Check API key and usage limits
3. **Network Issues**: Ensure stable internet connection

### Common Solutions

- **Restart Extension**: Disable and re-enable the extension
- **Reload Window**: `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P` ‚Üí "Developer: Reload Window"
- **Check Logs**: View "Output" panel ‚Üí "Cursor Voice Control"

## Privacy & Security

- **Audio Processing**: Audio is processed through Deepgram's secure APIs
- **API Keys**: Stored securely in VS Code settings
- **No Recording**: Audio is streamed in real-time, not recorded or stored
- **Local Processing**: Command interpretation happens locally when possible
