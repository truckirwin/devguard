# ==================================================================================

# CRITICAL STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS:

# 2. Between section header and delimiter: NO blank lines
# 3. Between delimiter and content: NO blank lines  
# 4. Between sections: NO blank lines EXCEPT in Student Notes
# 5. All ~ sections end with ~ delimiter line
# 6. All | sections end with | delimiter line (EXCEPT Student Notes which has no ending delimiter)

# EXACT SECTION ORDER (NEVER CHANGE):

# 2. ~ALT TEXT: + ~ delimiter  
# 3. ~REFERENCES: + ~ delimiter
# 4. ~SLIDE DESCRIPTION: + ~ delimiter
# 5. ~SCRIPT: + content with ~ prefixes + ~ delimiter
# 6. |INSTRUCTOR NOTES + | delimiter + bullets with â€¢ | + | delimiter

# - ALT TEXT: Actual visual descriptions for images/tables (empty if no visual elements)
# - REFERENCES: URLs and documentation links
# - SLIDE DESCRIPTION: Visual layout description for accessibility
# - SCRIPT: Complete instructor delivery script by AWS Technical Trainers
# - INSTRUCTOR NOTES: Bullet points with â€¢ | format
