SLIDE CONTENT:

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR REFERENCES:
- Provide 1-3 SPECIFIC, DEEP AWS documentation URLs (not generic home pages)
- URLs must be REAL and VALID (use actual AWS documentation structure)
- Focus on implementation guides, tutorials, and specific features mentioned in the slide
- Avoid top-level service home pages like docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/
- Each reference must be directly relevant to the specific concepts in this slide
- One high-quality, relevant reference is better than multiple generic ones

EXAMPLE GOOD REFERENCES (for reference only - analyze the actual slide content):
- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/algos.html (for algorithm implementations)
- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/your-algorithms-training-algo.html (for custom algorithms)
- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/author-job.html (for ETL job creation)

OUTPUT FORMAT:
REFERENCES:
[1-3 specific URLs relevant to the slide concepts - provide only as many as are truly relevant]

DEVELOPER NOTES:
[Brief overview notes about this slide concept. Write 2-3 plain text sentences describing what this slide covers and why it's important. Include 1-2 reference URLs if relevant. No markdown formatting - use plain text only. Keep it concise and focused on giving others a quick understanding of the slide's main concept.]""",

|Instructor Notes:

üö® CRITICAL FORMATTING RULES - NEVER CHANGE THESE üö®:
1. Script section: Use ~Script: header with ~ prefix on content lines and ~ terminator
2. Instructor Notes: Use |Instructor Notes: header with - | prefix for bullets, end with | terminator
3. Student Notes: Use |Student Notes: header but content is plain text without prefix
4. Alt text: Use ~Alttext: header with numbered ~ prefixed descriptions and ~ terminator
5. Slide Description: Use ~Slide Description: header with ~ prefix and ~ terminator
