# AWS Security Checklist for NotesGen Deployment

## üîê AWS Well-Architected Security Pillar Compliance

This checklist ensures the NotesGen application follows AWS security best practices based on the Well-Architected Framework Security Pillar.

---

## ‚úÖ Identity and Access Management (IAM)

### Principle of Least Privilege
- [x] **Deployment User**: Limited to specific NotesGen resources
- [x] **EC2 Role**: Minimum permissions for application runtime
- [x] **Resource-based policies**: S3 buckets, SSM parameters scoped to `notesgen-*`
- [x] **Regional restrictions**: Limited to `us-east-1` and `us-west-2`
- [x] **Conditional access**: MFA requirements, IP restrictions where applicable

### IAM Best Practices
- [x] **No root account usage**: Deployment uses dedicated IAM user
- [x] **Role-based access**: EC2 instances use IAM roles, not embedded credentials
- [x] **Access key rotation**: Script prompts for key rotation
- [x] **Resource tagging**: All resources tagged with Project, Environment, Purpose
- [x] **Policy versioning**: Support for policy updates without recreation

---

## üîí Data Protection

### Encryption at Rest
- [x] **S3 buckets**: Server-side encryption (AES256) enforced via policy
- [x] **RDS databases**: Encryption required for all DB instances
- [x] **EBS volumes**: Encryption enabled by default
- [x] **SSM Parameters**: SecureString type for sensitive configuration

### Encryption in Transit
- [x] **HTTPS/TLS**: All API communications over TLS 1.2+
- [x] **Database connections**: SSL/TLS required for RDS connections
- [x] **Internal communications**: Application configured for HTTPS

### Data Classification and Handling
- [x] **Sensitive data identification**: PPT content, user uploads
- [x] **Data retention policies**: Automated cleanup of temporary files
- [x] **Backup strategy**: Automated encrypted backups

## üåê Network Security

### VPC Configuration
- [ ] **Private subnets**: Application servers in private subnets
- [ ] **Public subnets**: Load balancers only in public subnets
- [ ] **NAT Gateway**: Secure outbound internet access
- [ ] **VPC Flow Logs**: Network traffic monitoring

### Security Groups
- [ ] **Principle of least privilege**: Minimal port exposure
- [ ] **Source restrictions**: No `0.0.0.0/0` sources for SSH/admin ports
- [ ] **Application ports**: Only necessary ports open (80, 443, 8000)
- [ ] **Database access**: Restricted to application security group only

---

## üìä Logging and Monitoring

### CloudWatch Logging
- [x] **Application logs**: Centralized logging to CloudWatch
- [x] **Error logs**: Separate log group for errors
- [x] **Log retention**: Appropriate retention periods set
- [x] **Log encryption**: CloudWatch logs encrypted

### Monitoring and Alerting
- [ ] **CloudTrail**: API call logging enabled
- [ ] **CloudWatch alarms**: Critical metrics monitoring
- [ ] **Security alerts**: Failed authentication attempts
- [ ] **Cost monitoring**: Budget alerts for unexpected costs

### Audit and Compliance
- [ ] **Access logging**: Who accessed what and when
- [ ] **Change tracking**: Infrastructure and application changes
- [ ] **Compliance reports**: Regular security posture reviews

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Infrastructure Security

### EC2 Instance Security
- [ ] **Latest AMIs**: Use up-to-date base images
- [ ] **Security patches**: Automated patching strategy
- [ ] **Instance metadata**: IMDSv2 enforced
- [ ] **No public IPs**: Private instances with load balancer

### Database Security
- [x] **RDS security**: Database in private subnet
- [x] **Parameter groups**: Secure database configuration
- [x] **Backup encryption**: Automated encrypted backups
- [ ] **Read replicas**: Cross-region if needed

---

## üîç Application Security

### Authentication and Authorization
- [ ] **Application authentication**: Secure user management
- [ ] **Session management**: Secure session handling
- [ ] **API security**: Rate limiting and input validation
- [ ] **CORS configuration**: Proper cross-origin settings

### Input Validation
- [ ] **File upload security**: PPT file validation
- [ ] **SQL injection prevention**: Parameterized queries
- [ ] **XSS protection**: Input sanitization
- [ ] **CSRF protection**: Anti-CSRF tokens

---

## üö® Incident Response

### Preparation
- [ ] **Response plan**: Documented incident response procedures
- [ ] **Contact information**: Emergency contact lists
- [ ] **Backup procedures**: Data recovery processes
- [ ] **Communication plan**: Stakeholder notification procedures

### Detection and Analysis
- [ ] **Security monitoring**: Automated threat detection
- [ ] **Log analysis**: Centralized log monitoring
- [ ] **Anomaly detection**: Unusual activity alerts
- [ ] **Forensics capability**: Log preservation and analysis

---

## üìã Compliance and Governance

### Resource Management
- [x] **Tagging strategy**: Consistent resource tagging
- [x] **Cost allocation**: Project-based cost tracking
- [ ] **Resource limits**: Service quotas and limits
- [ ] **Change management**: Controlled deployment process

### Documentation
- [x] **Architecture documentation**: System design documents
- [x] **Security policies**: Written security procedures
- [x] **Runbooks**: Operational procedures
- [ ] **Training materials**: Security awareness training
