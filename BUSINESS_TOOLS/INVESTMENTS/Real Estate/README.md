## 🎯 Grant Cardone's Key Investment Principles

### 1. **Scale Over Perfection**
- Buy multiple properties rather than waiting for perfect deals
- Focus on volume and velocity of transactions
- Aim for 10x returns through aggressive scaling

### 2. **Multi-Family Focus**
- Target apartment buildings (5+ units)
- Prefer Class B and C properties in emerging markets
- Avoid single-family homes (too much management overhead)

### 3. **Strategic Leverage**
- Use 80-90% loan-to-value ratios
- Prefer interest-only loans to maximize cash flow
- Refinance to pull out equity for additional purchases

### 4. **Value-Add Strategy**
- Buy properties below market value
- Implement operational improvements
- Renovate units to increase rents
- Improve property management efficiency
