
Error message:
Error invoking <name> model: 'AIModelInteraction' object has no attribute 'bedrock'
Reason:
Credentials are bad. Possible copy-paste error.
Fix 1: Re-enter credentials. 
Fix 2: Refresh Isengard web page in browser and copy fresh JSON credentials.

Error message:
Ascend crashes.
Look in the terminal or command window for any messages
Reason:
Installation issue, missing or corrupted library, conflict with package manager being used for development, including Python or Jupyter notebook development.
This is the most common reason. However, sometimes I have written code with system dependencies and not realized it. In several instances I have written expedient code knowing that sometimes there were conditions that could cause issues. My apologies. Specifically, this was in areas requiring multi-threaded programming to avoid timing issues and race conditions. In these cases I sometimes employed delay tricks to cover most cases. I had a choice to make the code simple and easy to maintain and expand or to code for real-time; and I chose simple.
Fix 1: Clear the application and reinstall following the latest installation notes.
Make sure you have installed and updated all libraries.
Make sure you have installed and updated boto3 to the latest version.
Fix 2: After reinstall remember to open a new command or terminal window to ensure that CLI has picked up the current OS path or it might not find the libraries.
Fix 3: In rare cases, there could be memory corruption requiring a reboot. That is, the crash corrupted critical interfaces in the OS that are refreshed by rebooting.
Fix 4: Send me the messages from the terminal or command window and any error message or context information about what you were trying to do and which button you pressed.

Error message:
You don't have permission to use the model.
Reason:
Most common is you authorized permission in a different region. Ascend is currently hard coded to us-east-1, and AI models are a regional resource.
Second most common is you missed one of the check boxes when you went through model access in the AWS console. Or you were looking at a different region when you requested access.
Fix : change region in AWS console and request model access in us-east-1..


Error message:
Error invoking model: An error occurred (AccessDeniedException) when calling the InvokeModelResponseStream operation: You don’t have access to the model with the specified model ID.
Notes:
You are using your Isengard account, with full admin access. You have access to all the necessary models and completed the installation as suggested. You are working within us-east-1. But still, you are getting this error. Adding AmazonBedrockFullAccess to your role did not solve the issue. 
Workaround 1:
- login to Isengard as normal with your default admin account
- from Isengard, open the json and copy the Access key ID, secret key, and Session token and paste them in the appropriate Ascend Credentials fields. 
- Change the region to us-east-1.
- Accept credentials. 

Workaround 2: (causes a security issue so only use as a test)
Got Ascend working by creating a user and attaching the AmazonBedrockFullAccess and AmazonSageMakerCanvasBedrockAccess policies to it. Then launched ascend from the command line. For credentials, I provided the Access key and Secret access key for the user. I was able to connect through ascend. I did not even need to request model access, and all models seem to be working for me.
