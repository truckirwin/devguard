1. Create a directory on your desktop called ASCEND

2. Copy these files into the directory:
   ascend.py
   ascend_ai.py
   ascend_ed.py
   ascend_template.pptx
   ascendAWSClientManager.py
   ascend_img.py             

3. Open a terminal window (Mac) or command window (Windows)

4. Navigate to the ASCEND directory.
   cd Desktop/ASCEND

5. Make sure you have python installed. It should be > version 3.11

Windows:
   python -V
Mac:
   python3 -V

6. Install required libraries

Windows:
   pip install pyqt5
   pip install boto3
   pip install markdown
   pip install python-pptx
   pip install Pillow
   pip install python-docx
   pip install PyMuPDF
   pip install openpyxl
   pip install beautifulsoup4
   pip install numpy
   pip install scikit-image
   pip install pygame   <-- New in 4.1

Mac: (see Conda notes below before installing) 
   pip3 install pyqt5
   pip3 install boto3
   pip3 install markdown
   pip3 install python-pptx
   pip3 install Pillow
   pip3 install python-docx
   pip3 install PyMuPDF
   pip3 install openpyxl
   pip3 install beautifulsoup4
   pip3 install numpy
   pip3 install scikit-image
   pip3 install pygame    <-- New in 4.1


*** START of Conda notes for Mac OSX

During the installation of required libs 
Some folks may be using a Conda environment for python. (verify by running "type -a python3" from Mac Terminal). 
For example, many folks who work with ipython or jupyter notebooks on their laptops on a regular basis, choose to have Conda manage their environment. 
(BTW many SageMaker labs also use Conda to provision SM environments and libraries)

If this is the case, using pip/pip3/brew will screw up existing Conda installation directories and libraries and the python script wont run with pyqt5. 
So instead of 
pip3 install pyqt5
try installing pyqt (and related libs) via conda: 
conda install --force-reinstall pyqt qt qtpy PyQtWebEngine PyQt5-sip 

after that, install all other required libs (boto3, markdown, etc) via pip3 as per instructions

finally, after restarting the terminal, make the *.py files executable 
chmod 755 ./*.py

*** END of Conda notes for Mac OSX


8. Close the command or terminal window and open a new one.
   This is necessary so the program can find pyqt5 and boto3.

9. Navigate to the ASCEND directory.
   cd Desktop/ASCEND


RUNNING THE PROGRAM

1. Open a command or terminal window.
2. Navigate to the ASCEND folder.
   cd /Desktop/ASCEND

3. Run the program:

Windows:

   python ascend.py

Mac:

   python3 ascend.py

The document Ascend_Introduction.doc introduces the program features.
